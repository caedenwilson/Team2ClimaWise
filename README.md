## Overview

The Smart Green HVAC System is a project that aims to provide an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solution for heating and cooling residential or commercial spaces. This system uses smart technology and advanced algorithms to optimize temperature control, reduce energy consumption, and lower carbon emissions.

## Code Description

The provided code is a basic simulation of the Smart Green HVAC System. It demonstrates how the system might work by simulating temperature control, power consumption estimation, and cost calculation. The code does the following:

1. **Initialization:** You can input the initial room temperature, the target room temperature, and the number of hours of operation.

2. **Temperature Control:** The code simulates temperature control based on the difference between the current temperature and the target temperature. It simulates heating and cooling modes.

3. **Power Consumption Estimation:** It estimates power consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) based on the simulated HVAC system's power usage.

4. **Cost Calculation:** The code calculates the total cost in dollars ($) based on the estimated power consumption and a user-defined cost per kWh.

Please note that this code is highly simplified and is intended for demonstration purposes. A real-world implementation of the Smart Green HVAC System would require more complex algorithms, integration with sensors and HVAC equipment, and consideration of various environmental factors.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have a C++ development environment set up to run the code.

2. Run the program and follow the on-screen instructions to input initial parameters.

3. Observe the simulated temperature control, power consumption, and cost calculations.

## Disclaimer

This code is for educational and illustrative purposes only. It does not represent a complete or functional HVAC system. A real-world implementation would require specialized hardware, software, and engineering expertise.
